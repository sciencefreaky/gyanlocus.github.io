     <h1><u>SCIENCE</u></h1>

     <h2><u>CHAPTER 1</u></h2>
     <h2> Nutrients in Plants </h2>
<p><h3>Nutrition is the process of taking food by an organism and its utilisation by the body. Green plants prepare their own food while humans and animals are directly or indirectly dependent on plants for their food.
<br>
<u>Modes of Nutrition:</u>
<br>
On the basis of a different mode of nutrition, organisms are categorised into two major types, i.e.
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left;">Autotrophs (auto-self, trobpos-nourishment) Autotrophic nutrition is the mode of nutrition in which organisms make their own food from the simple substance (e.g. CO2 and H2O) by the process of photosynthesis. Therefore, plants are called autotrophs.</li>

<li style="text-align:left;">Heterotrophs (heteros-other) Humans and animals do not contain chlorophyll and are dependent on plants for their food in readymade form. Those organisms which cannot prepare their own food and take food from green plants or animals are called heterotrophs and the mode of nutrition is called heterotrophic nutrition.</li>
</ul><br>
Photosynthesis;Food Making Process in Plants:-

The process by which autotrophic green plants make their own food from simple inorganic substances (carbon dioxide and water) in the presence of sunlight and green pigment or chlorophyll is known as photosynthesis.
<br>
Other Modes of Nutrition in Plants:-

There are some plants which do not contain chlorophyll in them and thus, cannot prepare their own food. These plants obtain their food from other plants or animal, i.e. they are heterotrophic in nature.
<br>
Parasitic Plants:-

A parasitic plant is one that lines inside or outside the other organism and derive their food from them. The plant (non-green) which obtains their food from other organism is called a parasite and the living organism from whose body, food is obtained is called host, e.g. amarbel or Cuscuta.
<br>
Insectivorous Plants:-

There are some plants which can trap insects and digest them for their nutrition. These plants are green in colour but lack nitrogen elements. To overcome this problem, these plants eat insects. Hence they are called insectivorous plant or carnivorous plants. 
<br>
Saprotrophic Plants:-

The mode of nutrition in which organisms take their nutrients from dead and decaying matter is called saprotrophic nutrition.
<br>
Replenishment of Nutrients in Soil:-

Crops require a lot of nitrogen to make proteins. After the harvest, the soil becomes deficient in nitrogen. Plants cannot use the nitrogen gas available in the atmosphere directly. The action of certain bacteria can convert this nitrogen into a form readily used by plants. Rhizobium bacteria live in the root nodules of leguminous plants. These bacteria take nitrogen gas from the atmosphere and convert it into water-soluble nitrogen compounds making it available to the leguminous plants for their growth.
</p></h3>
     
     <br>
     
     <h2><u>CHAPTER 2</u></h2>
     <h2> Nutrients in Animals </h2>
<p><h3>All animals require food for obtaining energy, growth, repair of damaged parts and functioning of the body. The process of taking food by an animal and its utilisation in the body is called animal nutrition.

The components of food such as carbohydrates are complex substances which cannot be utilised by the body. So, they are broken down into simpler substances. The process of breakdown of complex components of food into simpler substances is called digestion. There are two methods of digesting food, i.e. physical method (including chewing and grinding of food in mouth) and chemical method (addition of digestive juices to the food by the body itself).
<br>
Different Ways of Taking Food:-

Different types of animals show different modes of nutrition. Some animals filter tiny food particles and feed upon them, while some swollen the animals they prey upon. The mode of nutrition in different animals depends upon the special structure or organ for taking food inside the body.
<br>
Digestion in Humans:-

The food components pass through a continuous canal and get digested in each compartment. This is called an alimentary canal, it is ‘the tract or canal running from mouth to anus of human being where digestion and absorption of food take place.’
The alimentary canal can be divided into various compartments:
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left;">The buccal cavity</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Food pipe or oesophagus</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Stomach</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Small intestine</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Large intestine ending in the rectum</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">The anus</li>
</ul><br>

The main digestive glands which secrete digestive juices are:-
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left;">salivary gland</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">liver</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">pancreas</li>
</ul><br>

Digest system in Humans:
<ol type="1">
<li style="text-align:left;">Mouth and Buccal Cavity:-

The process of ingestion starts from the mouth or buccal cavity. As we ingest, food the salivary glands present in the mouth start its digestion. The teeth present in the buccal cavity cut the food into small pieces by chewing and grinding it. Salivary glands secrete a watery liquid, saliva. This saliva contains digestive enzymes which help in partial digestion of food (starch). The tongue helps in mixing saliva with food. This partially digested food is swallowed by the tongue and passed down to oesophagus or food pipe.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;"> Teeth:-

The food is cut by the teeth inside the mouth. Teeth mechanically break the food into small pieces. These teeth vary in appearance. Each tooth is rooted in a separate socket in the gums. There are 4 types of teeth:
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left;">Incisors</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Canines</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Molars</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Pre-Molars</li>
</ul>
<br>

<li style="text-align:left;">Tongue:-

It is a muscular organ attached at the back to the floor of the buccal cavity. It is free from the front and can help in mixing saliva with the food, swallowing the food, talking or speaking and tasting with the help of taste buds for sweet, salt, sour and bitter food.</li>
<br>

<li style="text-align:left;"> The food pipe or Oesophagus:-

It is the tube-like structure which connects the mouth to the stomach and runs along neck and chest. It carries slightly digested food from the mouth to the stomach.</li>
<br>

<li style="text-align:left;"> Stomach:-

It is a thick walled bag-like structure which is present on the left side of the abdomen. Its shape is like flattened U and it is the widest part of the alimentary canal. The semi-digested food from oesophagus enters into stomach where further digestion takes place.</li>
<br>

<li style="text-align:left;">Small intestine:-

The small intestine is a narrow tube which receives secretions from the liver and pancreas. The complete digestion of food takes place inside the small intestine and the food components are also absorbed here.</li>
<br>

<li style="text-align:left;">Large intestine:-

It is wider and shorter than the small intestine. The undigested semi-solid food is passed from small intestine to large intestine. The large intestine absorbs water and salt from the undigested food.</li>
</ol>
</p></h3>
     
     <br>
     
     <h2><u>CHAPTER 3</u></h2>
     <h2> Fibre to Fabric </h2>
<p><h3> Fibres are very thin, thread-like strands from which fabrics (or cloths) are made. Some examples of fibres are cotton, wool, silk, flax, jute, nylon, polyester and polyacrylic. The fibres are spun into yarn (long continuous thread) which can then be woven on a loom to make a fabric (or cloth). Yam is a kind of long, twisted thread. Yarn is made from fibres by the process of spinning.

     <br>
     
There are two types of fibres, i.e. natural fibre and man-made fibre (nylon, rayon).

     <br>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left;"><u>Wool:-</u>

The wool comes from animals like sheep, goat, yak, camel, llama and alpaca. 

The hair (wool) on the body of wool-yielding animals trap a lot of air. Air spaces between the wool fibres trap air. Since the air is a poor conductor of heat. So, the air trapped in hair shields the body from cold and keeps them warm in winter.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;"><u>From Fibres to Wool:-</u>

The wool comes mainly from sheep. For obtaining wool, sheep are reared and bred, their hair is cut and processed into wool.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;"><u>Silk:-</u>

Silk is a natural fibre which is obtained from an insect (called silk moth). So, silk fibres are also animal fibres. Silkworms spin the silk fibres. The silk fibre is made up of a protein. Silk is the strongest natural fibre.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;"><u>Sericulture:-</u>

Sericulture means ‘silk farming’. The rearing of silkworms for obtaining silk is called sericulture. Sericulture is a very old occupation in India. India produces a lot of silk on a commercial scale.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;"><u>Pure and Artificial Silk:-</u>

Pure silk is obtained from the cocoons of silkworm and it is made up of protein. Artificial silk is obtained from wood pulp and it is made of modified plant material ‘cellulose’. Just like silk, wool is also made up of proteins.</li>
</ul></p></h3>
     <br>
     <h2><u>CHAPTER 4</u></h2>
     <h2> Heat </h2>
<p><h3>Heat is a form of energy which makes the substance hot. In winter, it is our common experience that we feel cold inside the house and if we come out in front of sun rays, then we feel warm.
<br><br>
<u>Temperature and Thermometer:-</u>
The degree of hotness or coldness of the object is known as the temperature of an object. The temperature of an object is an only property that indicates which object is hot and which one is cold. A high temperature of a body indicates that it is very hot whereas a low temperature of the object indicates that it is quite cold.
It is measured by using an instrument called thermometer, which has a scale marked on it which is used to read the temperature, e.g. the scale in laboratory thermometer is marked along the length of thermometer’s tube between 0° mark and 100° mark into 100 equal divisions. So, each division is called a degree. The temperature of an object should always be stated with its unit. So, the most common unit for measuring temperature is degree Celsius (°C).
<br>
<u>Clinical Thermometer:-</u>
It is the thermometer which is used for measuring the temperature of the human body. In case of fever, it is used by a doctor (or at home) to measure the temperature of the patient. This thermometer consists of a long glass tube having a thin and uniform bore. There is a glass bulb at one end of the glass tube which consists of mercury .
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left">Features of a Clinical Thermometer:-
There is a very short range of temperature of a clinical thermometer, i.e. from 35°C to 42°C. The short range of a clinical thermometer is because of the fact that the temperature of human body normally does not go below 35°C or above 42°C.
Just above the bulb containing mercury, a clinical thermometer has a kink in its glass tube which is to prevent the back flow of mercury into the thermometer bulb when the thermometer bulb is removed from the mouth of a patient. This kink prevents the mercury level in the thermometer tube from falling on its own. Due to this, we can read the correct body temperature of the patient even after removing the thermometer bulb from his mouth.</li>
<br><br>
<u>Laboratory Thermometer:-</u>
A device which is used for measuring the temperature in a science laboratory is called a laboratory thermometer.
This thermometer is made up of a long glass tube having a thin bore. The graduation marked on the tube of a laboratory thermometer can measure the temperature from -10°C to 110°C, this is known as the range of a laboratory thermometer.
<br>
<li style="text-align:left"><u>Precautions in Using a Laboratory Thermometer:-</u></li>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left">While measuring temperature, the laboratory thermometer should be held vertically.</li>
<li style="text-align:left">The thermometer bulb should be surrounded from all sides by the substance whose temperature is to be measured.</li>
<li style="text-align:left">The thermometer reading should be taken while its bulb is still in touch with the substance whose temperature is being measured and by keeping the mercury level along the line of sight.</li>
<li style="text-align:left">The thermometer should not be held by the bulb.</li>
<li style="text-align:left">The thermometer should be carefully handled.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<li style="text-align:left"><u>Transfer of Heat:-</u></li>
Heat flows from a hot object to a cold object or heat flows from an object at the higher temperature to another object which is at a lower temperature. This flow of heat is known as the transfer of heat.
<br>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left">By conduction (in solid, heat is transferred by conduction)</li>

<li style="text-align:left">By convention (in liquid and gases, heat is transferred by convection)</li>

<li style="text-align:left">By radiation (in free space or vacuum, heat is transferred by radiation)</li>
</ul>
Conductors and Insulators:-

Materials which allow heat to be conducted through them easily are conductors of heat. Those metals such as iron, copper, silver, aluminium, etc., are good conductors of heat.

Bad conductors of heat are those materials which do not allow heat to be conducted through them easily. These materials are also known as insulators of heat. Wood, plastic and glass are insulators of heat.
</p></h3>

     <br>
     
     <h2><u>CHAPTER 5</u></h2>
     <h2> Acids and Bases </h2>
<p><h3>The word acid has been derived from a Latin word ‘acidus’ which means ‘sour’. Thus, all sour substances essentially contain acids. Substances like these which are bitter in taste and feel soapy on touch are known as bases. The chemical nature of such substances is said to be basic.
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left"><u>Acid Rain:-</u>

The rain containing excess of acids called an acid rain. The rain becomes acidic because carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide dissolve in rain drops to form carbonic acid, sulphuric acid and nitric acid respectively. It can cause damage to buildings, historical monuments, plants and animals.</li>

<li style="text-align:left"><u>This happens as follows:-</u></li>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left">Acid rain makes the water of lakes, ponds and rivers too acidic due to which fish and other aquatic animals get killed.</li>

<li style="text-align:left">Acid rain eats up the leaves of the trees gradually. By losing leaves, the trees die. Acid rain also damages crop plants in the fields.</li>

<li style="text-align:left">Acid rain damages the metal structures like steel bridges, etc when it falls on them.</li>

<li style="text-align:left">Acid rain damages the surfaces of buildings and monuments made up of marble.</li>
</ul>

<li style="text-align:left"><u>Neutralization:-</u>

Acids and bases are chemically opposite substances. So, when an acid is mixed with a base, they neutralise (or cancel) the effect of each other. When an acid solution and a base solution are mixed in suitable amounts, both the acidic nature of the acid and the basic nature of the base are destroyed. The resulting solution is neither acidic nor basic. So, the reaction between an acid and base is known as neutralisation. In the process of neutralisation, salt and water are produced with the evolution of heat.</li>

<li style="text-align:left"><u>Neutralisations in Everyday Life:-</u>

The neutralisation reactions involving acids and bases play a very important role in our everyday life. The treatment of an ant’s sting, remedy for indigestion, soil treatment and the treatment of factory wastes, all involve neutralisation reaction.</li>
</p>

     <br>
     
     <h2><u>CHAPTER 6</u></h2>
     <h2> Physical and Chemical Changes </h2>

<p><h3><u>Physical And Chemical Changes:-</u>

Changes occur around us all the time. Milk turns sour, seed germinate, the weather changes  and fruit ripen.
<br>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left"><u>Changes can be of different types:</u></li></ul>

<li style="text-align:left">desirable and undesirable changes.</li>

<li style="text-align:left">slow and fast changes.</li>

<li style="text-align:left">temporary and permanent changes.</li>

<li style="text-align:left">reversible and Irreversible changes.</li>

<li style="text-align:left">physical and chemical changes.</li>
<br>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left"><u>Physical changes:</u>  When a substance undergoes a physical change, it does not give rise to a different kind of substance or there is no new substance is formed. A physical change is a reversible change.
For example; heating of water  melting of butter, cutting of paper etc.</li></ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left"><u>Chemical changes:</u>
A Chemical change occurs when two or more chemical substances react to form new product that have an entirely different set of properties. A chemical change is mostly Irreversible. For example; cooking food, ripening of fruit, lighting a matchstick, aging of leaves and digestion of food etc.</li></ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left"><u>Chemical reaction:-</u>
A chemical change occurs when chemicals react with each other. Thus, a chemical change is also called a chemical reaction.</li></ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left"><u>Some of the properties of a chemical change or chemical reaction are:</u></li></ul>

<li style="text-align:left">Change in energy</li>

<li style="text-align:left">Change in color</li>

<li style="text-align:left">Evolution of gas</li>

<li style="text-align:left">Formation of precipitate</li>
<br>
To understand chemical reactions, let us learn about elements, molecules and compounds.
<br> 
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left">Elements: Substances that consists of only one type of atoms and cannot be broken down into simple substances either physically or chemically are known as elements.
Elements can be classified into two broad groups- metals and nonmetals.
For example: Iron, copper, oxygen and carbon.</li></ul><br>
 
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left">Compounds: Substances in which two or more elements are combined together chemically in definite proportions are known as compounds.
For example; two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen combine in a definite proportion to form a molecule of water.</li></ul><br>
 
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left">Mixtures: Substances in which two or more substances are mixed together physically in no definite proportion are known as mixtures.
For example; sugar solution.</li></ul><br>


<u>Chemical formula:-</u>

The symbolic representation of the composition of a chemical compound is known as its chemical formula. For example; the chemical formula of sodium chloride is NaCl.<br>

<u>Valency:-</u>

The combining capacity of the atom of an element with the atom of other elements is known as its valency.<br>

<u>Chemical equations:-</u>

A Chemical change resulting in the formation of one or more new substances is called a chemical reaction. The representation of a chemical reaction using symbols and formulae of the elements or compounds involved in the reaction is known as chemical equation.

</h3></p>
 <br>
     <h2><u>CHAPTER 7</u></h2>
     <h2> Weather, Climate and Adaptation of Animals to Climate </h2>
<p><h3><u>Weather:-</u>

It may be defined as the day to day condition of the atmosphere at a place with respect to the temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind speed, etc.
<br><br>
Elements of Weather:-
The temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind speed and other factors are called the elements of the weather which are described below:
<ol type="1">
<li style="text-align:left">Temperature:-

The weather is mainly affected by the sun that produces heat and raise the temperature. The sun provides light as well as heat on the earth. It is necessary for the production of energy. The < heat from the sun is absorbed by the earth’s surface, oceans and atmosphere which plays an important role in determining the weather of any place.</li>

<li style="text-align:left">Rainfall:-

The amount of water droplets that fall back on the earth after condensation of water vapours is called rainfall. When the temperature is too low, these droplets in the cloud get freezed into crystals of ice and comes on the earth as snowfall. During winters, the temperature falls after sunset causing condensation of water vapours near the ground. These droplets hang in the air to form fog.</li>

<li style="text-align:left">Humidity:-

It is defined as ‘the amount of water vapour in air which causes dampness of air’. Air has the ability to hold certain . amount of water vapour. The capacity of air to hold water increases with rise in temperature and falls if heavy rainfall occurs.</li>

<li style="text-align:left">Wind Speed:-

It is caused due to the difference in air pressure. During summer, the wind blows from Indian ocean and Bay of Bengal and causes rain in India while during winter, it blows from the mountain of north India towards northern plain and causes cold weather.</li>
<br>
<u>Climate:-</u>

‘The average weather pattern taken over a long time, is called the climate of that place.’ Different places in the world have different types of climate. The annual record of long term average temperature and rainfall at a particular place is called climate chart.

Factors that Determine the Climate:-

The several factors that determine the climate at a place are:
<ul type="disc">
<li style="text-align:left">Distance from the sea Climate of a place varies according to the closeness of the sea. The places that are near the sea, are moderate (not too hot nor too cold), e.g. Mumbai, Chennai. While the places that are away from the sea have extreme climate, having very hot summer or too cold winter, e.g. Delhi.</li>

<li style="text-align:left">Altitude or height above sea level Climate also varies according to the altitude. The higher altitudes are cooler, e.g. Himalaya.</li>

<li style="text-align:left">Humidity It also determines the climate of a place. Kolkata and Kerala have high humidity, while. Rajasthan and Haryana have low humidity.</li>
</ul><br>
<u>Climate and Adaptation:-</u>

The ability of an organism to develop certain features which improve the chances of its survival in the environment in which they live, is known as adaptation.
<br>
Adaptations are of three types:
<ol type="i">
<li style="text-align:left">Structural adaptations Adaptation of special body parts of an organism that helps it to survive in its natural habitat, e.g. skin colour, shape, body covering.</li>

<li style="text-align:left">Behavioural adaptations Adaptation of special ways in a particular organism that helps it to survive in its natural habitat. It usually occurs in response to some external stimuli.</li>

<li style="text-align:left">Physiological adaptations Adaptation of body systems presents in an organism that allows it to perform the certain biochemical reaction, e.g. warm-blooded animals are able to keep the constant body temperature.</li></ol>
<br>
<u>Migration:-</u>

Migration is the seasonal journey taken by different animals or birds to escape the extreme climatic condition and the search of food, e.g. Siberian cranes migrates towards warmer region in the autumn by travelling several thousands of kilometers.
</h3></p>

 <br>
     <h2><u>CHAPTER 8</u></h2>
     <h2> Winds, Storms and Cyclones </h2>

<p><h3>We live on the earth which is surrounded by air. The layer of air surrounding the earth is called atmosphere. The moving air is called wind. It is formed by the heat of the sun or it may be said that unequal heating of different parts of the earth forms wind.
<br>
<u>Air Exerts Pressure:-</u>

The continuous physical force exerted on an object or against an object when something comes in contact with it, is called pressure.
<br>
Importance of Air pressure:-

The importance of air pressure can be discussed as follows:
<ul type="disc">
<li style="text-align:left">It creates wind The difference in atmospheric pressure gives rise to the wind on the earth.</li>

<li style="text-align:left">It influences weather Air movement, i.e. downward or upward movement of air caused due to differences in pressure creates the cloudy and clear sky, brings rain or fine weather.</li>

<li style="text-align:left">Weather forecasting The changes in air pressure gives important clues for weather forecasting. The air pressure is measured by an instrument called barometer.</li>
</ul><br>
<u>Air Expands on Heating:-</u> 

Gases or air expand more than solid and liquid on heating. Air is a mixture of gases. On heating, the molecules of air gain kinetic energy. It moves away from each other, thus occupying more space. Therefore, the air becomes lighter. Warm air rises up whereas comparatively cool air tends to sink towards the earth’s surface.
<br>
<u>Wind Currents:-</u>

The wind is the movement of air which depends on the difference in air pressure in two regions. Air moves from the region of high pressure to the region of low pressure in the atmosphere. This difference in air pressure is created by uneven heating or unequal heating on the earth. The region where the air rises, an area of low pressure is created while the region where the air sinks, an area of high pressure is created.
<br>
<u>Thunderstorms:-</u>

When air moves gently (low speed), it is called a breeze while when it moves violently (high speed), it is called a storm. When the pressure of air drops, it indicates the possibility of a storm. The swift movement of the falling water along with the rising warm air producing sound, lightning, heavy rain and • strong wind is called thunderstorm. It develops in hot and humid tropical areas like India and is accompanied by heavy rains or hail.
<br>
<u>Cyclones:-</u>

A cyclone is a weather condition consisting of a system of high-speed winds revolving around a central area of very low pressure. Cyclones develop over tropical seas. It is a violent storm with a wind speed of 150-250 km/h. It is accompanied by strong winds and heavy rains.
<br>
<u>Tornadoes:-</u>

A tornado is a violent spinning storm in the shape of a dark funnel with a narrow end on the land.
These are formed over the sea and are called water spouts. Tornado develops from the thunderstorm and is formed mostly on the land. These are violent and can reach the speeds of more than 500 km/h destroying everything in their path.
</h3></p>
 <br>
     <h2><u>CHAPTER 9</u></h2>
     <h2> Soil </h2>

<p><h3>
 Soil is one of the most important natural resources. It is the uppermost layer of earth’s crust which is blackish-brown in colour. 
<br><ul type="square">
<li style="text-align:left">Major functions of the soil are:</li></ul>
<li style="text-align:left">It supports plant growth by holding the roots firmly and supplying water and nutrients to the plants.</li>
<li style="text-align:left">It acts as a natural habitat for many organisms like an earthworm, fungi, bacteria, ants, etc.</li>
<li style="text-align:left">It is also essential for agriculture which provides us with food, clothing and shelter for all.</li>
<li style="text-align:left">It supplies water and nutrients to plants. Therefore, we can say that soil is an inseparable part of our life.</li>
<br>
<u>Soil Pollution:-</u>

Sometimes people throw polythene bags and plastic articles in the soil. They pollute the soil and also hill the useful organisms living in the soil. Some other substances like chemicals and pesticides also pollute the soil.

To prevent the soil pollution, the use of polythene bags must be banned, and the waste products and chemicals must be treated before they are released into the soil. The use of pesticides in the agricultural field must also be minimised in order to prevent soil pollution.
<br><br>
<u>Soil Profile:-</u> 

Soil is formed by breaking down of rocks by the action of wind, water or climate by the process called weathering. During this process, the rocks are worn away to form small particles by long exposure to the elements of weather.

Weathering is a very slow process as it takes thousands of years for a huge rock to turn into fine particles. The nature of the soil depends upon the rocks from which it has been formed and types of vegetation that grow on it.

The soil profile is a vertical section through different layers of the soil.

Soil profile consists of different layers of soil which are called horizon. Each horizon differs in texture, colour, depth and chemical composition. Different horizons of the soil are discussed further.

There are 4 horizons:

<u>Soil Types:-</u>

The weathering of rocks produces small particles of various materials, these include sand and clay. The relative amount of sand and clay depends upon the rock from which the particles were formed.

On the basis of sizes, the rock particles present in soil can be divided mainly into four major groups:

<li style="text-align:left">Clay</li>
<li style="text-align:left">Silt</li>
<li style="text-align:left">Sand</li>
<li style="text-align:left">Gravel</li>
<br>
<ul type="none">
<li style="text-align:left">Properties of Soil:-
Soil possesses various properties like:</li></ul>

<li style="text-align:left">It contains air.</li>
<li style="text-align:left">It can hold water or moisture.</li>
<li style="text-align:left">It can absorb or soak water.</li>
<li style="text-align:left">It allows water to pass down through it.</li>
<br>
<u>Soil and Crops:-</u>

Different types of soil are found in different parts of India. Soil is mainly affected by wind, rainfall, temperature, light and humidity. Some climatic factors also affect the soil profile and bring changes in the soil structure. The plants that grow on the surface of the earth are called vegetation. It includes green grass, herbs, shrubs, bushes, crop plants and trees.

<br><ul type="none">
<li style="text-align:left">Clayey soil: Wheat,Gram and Paddy.</li>

<li style="text-align:left">Loamy soil: Tomatoes, Corn and Oats.</li>

<li style="text-align:left">Sandy-Loamy soil: Potatoes, Cotton and Cereal Rye.<li></ul>
<br>
<u>Soil Erosion:-</u>

The removal of land surface by water wind or ice is known as erosion. The topsoil is very fertile and in the absence of it, the plants cannot grow. In the absence of plants, the soil becomes loose. As the plant roots bind to the soil. Soil erosion is mainly caused by the large scale cutting of forest trees and plants.

     <h2><u>CHAPTER 10</u></h2>
     <h2> Respiration in Organisms </h2>

<p><h3>The process of breakdown of food in the cells of an organism with the release of energy is called cellular respiration.
<br>
<u>Types of Respiration:-</u>

On the basis of the presence or absence of oxygen, respiration is classified into two types:
<ol type="1">
<li style="text-align:left">Aerobic Respiration:

When the breakdown of glucose occurs with the use of oxygen, it is called aerobic respiration. During aerobic respiration, glucose is completely broken down into carbon dioxide and water and energy is released.</li> 

<li style="text-align:left">Anaerobic Respiration:

When a breakdown of glucose takes place without using oxygen, it is called anaerobic respiration. The glucose is not completely broken down into carbon dioxide and water. An intermediate compound is formed with the release of less amount of energy during this process.</li> 
</ol>

<u>Breathing:-</u>

It is the process in which air rich in oxygen is taken inside and air rich in CO2 is given out, with the help of respiratory organs. Thus, breathing involves two steps which take place alternately.
<br>
<li style="text-align:left">Inhalation: Taking in of air rich in oxygen into our body is called inhalation.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left">Exhalation: Giving out air rich in carbon dioxide from our body to the external environment is called exhalation.</li>
<br>
<u>Mechanism of Breathing:-</u>

The mechanism of breathing can be understood by the following points:
<ul type="dics">
<li style="text-align:left">Normally, we take in air through our nostrils. When we inhale air, it passes through our nostrils into the nasal cavity.</li>
<li style="text-align:left">From the nasal cavity, the air reaches our lungs through the windpipe.</li>
<li style="text-align:left">Lungs are present in the chest cavity. This cavity is surrounded by ribs on the sides.</li>
<li style="text-align:left">A large, muscular sheet called diaphragm forms the floor of the chest cavity.</li>
</ul><br>
<u>Respiration in Plants:-</u>

All the organism in the world respires whether it is an animal or a plant. Plants also take in oxygen from the air and give out carbon dioxide. They also breakdown glucose into C02 and water and releases energy to perform other functions. The respiration in plants differs from the animal because in plants, respiration occurs through leaves and roots, etc. They carry out respiration independently, i.e. each plant part can independently take in oxygen from the air, utilise it to obtain energy and give out CO2.
<br>
<u>Exchange of Gases:-</u>

The exchange of gases takes place in the plants all the time, but it is increased during day time. The leaves are more actively involved in photosynthesis during the day time in the presence of sunlight. The CO2 released during respiration is utilised by the plant during photosynthesis to produce its food.

During photosynthesis, the O2 is released by plants which are taken up during respiration in plants. Therefore, a balance between CO2 and O2 is maintained by the plants.
Respiration thus provides continuous energy to plants to perform all its functions regardless of time.
