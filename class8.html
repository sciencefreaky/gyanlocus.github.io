     <h2><u>CHAPTER 1</u></h2>
      <h2> Crop Production and Management </h2>
<p><h3>In our country three categories of crops are grown:
<ol type="i">
<li style="text-align:left;"><u>Kharif Crops:</u> The crops which are grown in the rainy season (i.e., from June to September) are called Kharif crops. Paddy, maize, soybean, groundnut, and cotton are Kharif crops.</li>

<li style="text-align:left;"><u>Rabi Crops:</u> The crops are grown in the winter season (i.e., from October to March) are called rabi crops. Examples of rabi crops are wheat, gram, pea, mustard, and linseed.</li>

<li style="text-align:left;"><u>Zaid Crops (or Summer Crops):</u> The crops grown in the summer season are ( called zaid crops. Moong, muskmelon, watermelon, cucumber, gourd and bitter gourd are examples of zaid crops.</li>
</ol>

Cultivation of crops involves the following activities:-
<ol type="i">
<li style="text-align:left;"><u>Soil Preparation:</u> It involves loosening and tilling of the soil (i.e., ploughing and watering).</li>

<li style="text-align:left;"><u>Sowing:</u> Sowing is the process of putting seeds in the soil.</li>

<li style="text-align:left;"><u>Adding Manure and Fertilisers:</u> The substances, which are added to the soil in the form of nutrients to improve the production of the crops and fertility of the soil are called manure and fertilisers.</li>

<li style="text-align:left;"><u>Irrigation:</u> Supply of water to crops at appropriate intervals is called irrigation.</li>

<li style="text-align:left;"><u>Protection from Weeds:</u> Weeds are the unwanted plants that grow along with the crops. Its removal is a must for the better growth of the crops. These can be controlled by spraying certain chemicals, called weedicides, like 2, 4-D.</li>

<li style="text-align:left;"><u>Harvesting:</u> The cutting of the crop after it is mature is called harvesting.</li>
</ol>
<ul type="none">
<li style="text-align:left;">Storage: If the crop grains are to be kept for a longer time, they should be safe from moisture, insects and rats.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">Humus: Humus is the top layer of the soil formed by decaying or decomposition of organic matters like animal remains, shed leaves, the dung of cattle.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">Pests: Pests are the insects or rodents that destroy’much of our crop yield. Thus, it is necessary to save crops from pests.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">Food from Animals: Like plants, the animals also provide us with different kinds of food like fish, meat and eggs.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">Fumigation: Fumigation is the most effective method for checking the growth of insects by providing smoke or chemicals in the gaseous state without affecting the grain.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">Agricultural practices: There are various activities that have to be performed, before sowing and up to harvesting. These are called agricultural practices.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">Animal husbandry: Animals reared at home or on a farm, have to be provided with proper food, shelter and care, when this is done on a large scale it is called animal husbandry.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">Seeds: A plant’s fertilised ovules, from which a new plant may grow, are called seeds.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">Sowing: It is a process to put seeds in the soil.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">Storage: It is to keep crop grains safe from moisture, insects and rats for a long time.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">Threshing: The process of separation of grains from the chaff in the harvested plant is called threshing.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">Weeds: Some undesirable or unwanted plants may grow naturally along with the crop, such plants are called weeds.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">Weedicides: Those certain chemicals which are used to control weeds are called weedicides. For example 2, 4-D (2, 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid), metolachlor.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">Winnowing: A process to bring out the separation of grain and chaff is called winnowing.</li>

     <h2><u>CHAPTER 2</u></h2>
     <h2> Microorganisms – Friend and Foe </h2>
<p><h3>Microorganisms are too small and are not visible with the naked eye.
They can live in all kinds of environment, ranging from ice cold climate to hot springs, deserts and marshy lands.
Microorganisms are found in air, water and in the bodies of plants and animals.
They may be unicellular or multicellular.
Microorganisms include bacteria, fungi, protozoa and some algae. Viruses though different from the above-mentioned living organisms are referred to as microbes.
Viruses are quite different from other microorganisms. They reproduce only inside the cells of the host organism: bacterium, plant or animal.
<br>
<u>Friendly Microorganisms:-</u>

The bacterium, Lactobacillus converts milk into curd.

Bacteria are also involved in the making of cheese, pickles and many other food items.

Acetobacter aceti bacteria is used for the production of acetic acid from alcohol.

Yeast is used for commercial production of alcohol and wine by growing them on natural sugars present in grains like barley, wheat, rice and crushed fruit juices etc.

Antibiotics are manufactured by growing specific microorganisms and are used to cure a variety of diseases.

Some microorganisms reside in the root nodules of leguminous plants. They can fix atmospheric nitrogen from the air into the soil and increase soil fertility.

Specialized bacteria convert nitrates and nitrites present in the soil into nitrogen gas which is released in the atmosphere.

Some microorganisms decompose organic wastes like dead plants and animals into simple substances and clean up the environment.
<br><br>
<u>Harmful Microorganisms:-</u>

The bacterium, Lactobacillus converts milk into curd.

Disease-causing microorganisms are called pathogens.

Common ailments like cold, influenza (flu) and most coughs are caused by viruses. Serious diseases like polio and chicken pox are also caused by viruses.

Diseases like dysentery and malaria are caused by protozoans.

Typhoid and tuberculosis (TB) are caused due to bacteria.
<ol type="i">
<li style="text-align:left;">Algae: A group of plants which is mostly aquatic. They are autotrophs (i.e., have chlorophyll). Their body is not divided into root, stem and leaf.</li>

<li style="text-align:left;">Antibiotics: The medicines that kill or stop the growth of disease-causing microorganisms are called antibiotics.</li>

<li style="text-align:left;">Bacteria: Bacteria are single-celled microorganism. They can be seen only under a microscope. Their cells are prokaryotic (primitive type).</li>

<li style="text-align:left;">Carrier: The organisms which carry the pathogen from a diseased person to a healthy person are called carriers. For example, female Anopheles mosquito.</li>

<li style="text-align:left;">Communicable Diseases: Microbial diseases that can be spread from an infected person to a healthy person through the air, water, food or physical contact are called communicable diseases.</li>

<li style="text-align:left;">Fermentation: The process of conversion of sugar into alcohol by yeast is called fermentation.</li>

<li style="text-align:left;">Fungi: Fungi are non-green plants. They cannot synthesize their own food. They may be unicellular or multicellular.</li>

<li style="text-align:left;">Pathogen: Disease-causing microorganisms are called pathogens.</li>

<li style="text-align:left;">Vaccine: The substance which is injected to trigger the body to develop its own defence (by producing antibodies) is called vaccine.</li>

<li style="text-align:left;">Virus: Viruses are living only inside other living cells. They are considered as connecting link between living and non-living.</li>
</ol></h3></p>
     <h2><u>CHAPTER 3</u></h2>
     <h2> Synthetic Fibres and Plastics </h2>
<p><h3>Synthetic fibres and plastics, similar to natural fibres are made up of very large units. The larger units are called polymers. These are made up by combining many similar or dissimilar small units. The small units are called monomers.
Natural fibres are obtained from plant and animal sources, synthetic fibres are obtained by chemical processing of petrochemicals. The synthetic fibres can be woven into a fabric, just like natural fibres.
Synthetic fibres have a wide range of uses ranging from many household articles like ropes, buckets, furniture, containers, etc. to highly specialized use in aircrafts, ships, spacecrafts, health care, etc.
Depending upon the types of chemicals used for the manufacture, some synthetic fibres are rayon, nylon, polyester and acrylic. Soon, are durable, less expensive, readily available and easy to maintain.
<br>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left;">Plastics: All plastics do not have the same kind of arrangement of small units. These can be either linear or cross-linked.
</ul></li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Plastics can be easily moulded into any shape.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Plastics can be recycled, reused, coloured, melted, rolled into sheets or made into wires.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Thermoplastic is a plastic which gets deformed easily on heating and can be bent easily e.g., Polythene and PVC. These are used for manufacturing toys, combs, car grills and various types of containers.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Thermosetting Plastics: There are some plastics which when moulded once cannot be softened by heating. These are called thermosetting plastics.</li>
</ul><br>
Petrochemicals: All the synthetic fibres are prepared by a number of processes using raw materials of petroleum origin, called petrochemicals.
<br>
Biodegradable: Materials which get decomposed through natural processes are called biodegradable.
<br>
Non-biodegradable: Those materials which are not easily decomposed by natural processes are called non-biodegradable.
<br>
Acrylic: These are the synthetic fibres which resemble natural wool. They are durable and affordable.
<br>
Artificial Silk: Artificial silk or rayon is a man-made fibre made from wood pulp. It has properties similar to that of silk.
<br>
Nylon: Nylon is a fully synthetic fibre. It is prepared from coal, water and air.
<br>
Plastic: Plastic is a polymer like synthetic fibre. Arrangement of units in some plastics is linear whereas in others it is cross-linked.
<br>
Polyester: Polyester is a synthetic fibre. Fabric made from this fibre does not get wrinkled easily. It remains crisp and is easy to wash.
<br>
Polymer: The word “Polymer” comes from two Greek words, poly meaning many and mer meaning part/unit.

     <h2><u>CHAPTER 6</u></h2>
     <h2> Combustion and Flame </h2>
<p><h3>Combustible Substances: The substances which burn in the air are called combustible.

Oxygen in the air is essential for combustion.

During the process of combustion, heat and light are given out.

Ignition temperature is the lowest temperature at which a combustible substance catches fire.

Inflammable substances have very low ignition temperature.

Fire can be controlled by removing one or more requirements essential for producing fire.

Water is commonly used to control the fire.

Water cannot be used to control fires involving electrical equipment or oils.
<br><br><ul type="none">
<li style="text-align:left;">There are various types of combustions such as:</li></ul>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">Rapid Combustion: A combustion, that takes place rapidly/high speed, with the production of heat and light is called rapid combustion.</li>

<li style="text-align:left;">Spontaneous Combustion: A combustion in which a material suddenly bursts into flames, without the application of any apparent cause is called spontaneous combustion.</li>

<li style="text-align:left;">Explosion: The process of combustion in which a large number of gases are evolved with the production of a tremendous amount of heat, light and sound is called an explosion.</li>
<br><br><ul type="none">
<li style="text-align:left;">There are three different zones of a flame:</li></ul>

</h3></p>
     <h2><u>CHAPTER 7</u></h2>
     <h2> Conservation of Plants and Animals </h2>
<p><h3>A great variety of plants and animals exist on earth. They are essential for the well being and survival of mankind.

Deforestation means clearing of forests and using that land for other purposes. 
<ul type="none">
<li style="text-align:left;">Trees in the forests are cut for some of the purposes mentioned below:</li></ul>
<ol type="i">
<li style="text-align:left;">Procuring land for cultivation</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Building houses and factories</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Making furniture or using wood as fuel</li></ol>

The increase in temperature on the earth disturbs the water cycle and may reduce rainfall. This can cause droughts.

Deforestation results in the conversion of fertile land into deserts because of less humus. This is called desertification.

Wildlife sanctuary, national park and biosphere reserve are names given to the areas meant for conservation and preservation of forest and wild animals.

Biodiversity refers to the variety of living organisms found in a specific area.

The plants and animals of a particular area are known as the flora and fauna of that area.

Endemic species are those species that are found only in a particular area and not anywhere else.

The endangered species are those which are facing the danger of extinction because their numbers are diminishing.

We should save, reuse and recycle paper to save trees, energy and water.

A project, that was launched to ensure the survival and maintenance of the tiger population are called Project Tiger.

Ecosystem is the term used for the interaction between the biotic and abiotic factors.

The biotic factors of the ecosystem are plants, animals and microorganisms, while the abiotic factors are climate, humidity, air, soil, etc.

<li style="text-align:left;">Ecosystem: The interaction between the biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) factors is called an ecosystem.</li>

<li style="text-align:left;">Migratory Birds: Migratory birds fly to far away areas every year during a particular time because of the climatic changes in that area.</li>

<li style="text-align:left;">National Park: The reserved area for wildlife where they can freely use the habitats and natural resources.</li>

<li style="text-align:left;">Red Data Book: The sourcebook, which keeps a record of all endangered animals and plants.</li>

<li style="text-align:left;">Reforestation: It is restocking of the destroyed forests by planting new trees of the same species, which were existing in that forest.</li>

     <h2><u>CHAPTER 8</u></h2>
     <h2> Cell – Structure and Functions </h2>
<p><h3>All organisms are the combination of different parts, i.e., called organs.

Roots, stems, leaves and flowers are the organs of plants.

Hands, feet, legs, heart, kidney etc. are the organs of animals.

All organs are made up of tissues which in turn are made up of cells.

Though organisms differ in shape and size, these are all made up of a basic unit called cells.

Cells present in living organism, differ in numbers, shape and size.

Bacteria (PPLO) has the smallest cell size of 0.1 microns. Ostrich egg has the largest cell size of 170 mm.

The shape of cells varies from spherical, cuboidal, columnar to long and branched types.

Some cells have an irregular shape, i.e., Amoeboid shape, in case of amoeba.

There are unicellular organisms (bacteria) as well as multicellular organisms (plants and animals).

Each cell has smaller components, called organelles. Some of these are common to different cell types. Each organelle has its own specific function.

The single cell of unicellular organisms performs all the basic functions, i.e., performed by a variety of cells in multicellular organisms.
<br><br><ul type="none">
<li style="text-align:left;">The cell has three main parts:</li></ul>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">the cell membrane</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">cytoplasm which contains smaller components called organelles</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">the nucleus.</li>
<br>
Nucleus is separated from the cytoplasm by a nuclear membrane.

Nucleus acts as a control centre for all the activities of the cell.

Nucleus contains some smaller spherical body, i.e., nucleolus and threadlike structure, i.e., chromosomes.

The chromosomes carry genes that help in inheritance or transfer of characters from parents to the offspring.

Nucleoplasm is the liquid material of the nucleus.

Cells without a well-organised nucleus, i.e., lacking a nuclear membrane, Eire called prokaryotic cells.

Plant cells differ from animal cells in having an additional layer around the cell membrane termed as the cell wall.

Coloured organelle, i.e., called plastids, are found in the plant cells only. Green plastids containing chlorophyll are called chloroplasts.

Plant cell has a big central vacuole unlike a number of small vacuoles in animal cells.

Cell is the basic structural and functional unit of all living organisms.
<br><br>
Cell Membrane: Cell membrane is a membrane around the cell. It is also called the plasma membrane.

Cell wall is a hard and rigid covering of plasma membrane and found in plant cells only.

Chloroplasts are the green coloured plastids having chlorophyll, a winch is essential for photosynthesis.

Chromosomes are a thread like structures found in the nucleus. It carries genes.

Protoplasm is the viscous fluid inside the cell which provides living nature to it.
<ul type="none">
<li style="text-align:left;">Eukaryotes: The organisms having eukaryotic cells, i.e., contains a well developed nucleus are called eukaryotes.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">Gene: Genes are located on chromosomes. Gene is a unit of inheritance in living organisms.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">Tissue: A tissue is a group of similar cells performing a specific function.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">Unicellular is the category or organism like bacteria containing only a single cell.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">Vacuoles: Are the empty or blank looking structures in the cytoplasm.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">White blood cells (WBC): It is one of the components of blood cells. It is an example of a single cell which can change its shape.</li>

<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">Ova: Ovary produces females gametes called ova (Egg).</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">Asexual Reproduction: The type of reproduction in which only a single parent is involved, is called asexual reproduction.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">Binary Fission: In binary fission, a single-celled individual reproduces by dividing itself into two. Example: Amoeba.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">Budding: In this type of reproduction, a lateral bud arises from the body’ of the parent organism, it matures and gets detached from the body to behave as a new organism.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">Fertilization: The fusion of ovum and the sperm is called fertilization.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">Internal Fertilisation: Fertilisation that takes place inside the female body is called internal fertilisation. This is observed in human beings and other animals such as cows and dogs.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">External Fertilisation: Fertilisation that takes place outside the female body is called external fertilisation. This is common in aquatic animals such as frogs, fish, starfish, etc.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">Foetus: It is the stage of embryo in which all the body parts are identifiable in its developmental stage.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">Viviparous: Animals such as human beings, cows and dogs which give birth to the young ones are called Viviparous animals.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">Oviparous: Animals such as hen, frog and butterfly which lay eggs are called oviparous animals.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">Zygote: The nuclei of sperm(n) and egg(n) are fused during fertilization, to form a single nucleus. Egg after fertilization is called Zygote.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">Cloning: Cloning is the creation of an organism that is an exact genetic copy of another. This means that every single bit of DNA is the same between the two organisms.</li></ul>
