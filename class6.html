     <h1><u>SCIENCE</u></h1>

     <h2><u>CHAPTER 1</u></h2>
     <h2> Food: Where Does it Come from? </h2>
     <p><h3>Food is needed by all living beings for four main purposes for their growth, to provide energy for doing work, for the repair and replacement of the damaged tissues, to provide resistance and protection against diseases from infections. Human beings are omnivores. Our food comes from different sources. We get food from plants as well as animals. We eat animals (as meat) as well as their different products like milk, eggs and honey. Cooked food can be easily consumed and absorbed by our body. Cooking also kills the harmful germs.</p></h3>
     
     <br>          
     
     <h2><u>CHAPTER 2</u></h2>
     <h2> Components of food </h2>
<p><h3>Food: It is the group of edible substances which provide energy to the living beings and repair the old tissues and build the new tissues. Nutrition: The process of consuming nutrients required for the growth and development of our body and to obtain energy is known as nutrition. Our food contains three main substances called nutrients. These are fats, proteins and carbohydrates. In addition, our body requires water, salts (minerals), vitamins and fibres. Diet: It is the amount of food eaten by a person at a time. Malnutrition: If a person does not get adequate food, or if his/her diet does not contain all the nutrients, he or she becomes weak. When the body does not get adequate nutrition, it is said to be suffering from malnutrition. Various food components are grouped in three classes: Energy giving food: Carbohydrates and fats. Bodybuilding food: Proteins. Protective food: Vitamins and minerals.</p></h3>
     
     <br>
     
     <h2><u>CHAPTER 3</u></h2>
     <h2> Fibre to Fabric </h2>
<p><h3>Clothes are made mostly from fibres. Fibres are thin strands of thread, that are woven to make fabric, for example, cotton fabric, silk fabric, etc. The fabric is stitched to make clothes. For example, cotton fabric can be stitched into a cotton frock or a cotton kurta. There are two main processes of making fabric from fibre – weaving and knitting. <br>
       Fibres used to make fabric may be natural or synthetic. Fibres that are obtained from plants or animals are called natural fibres. Examples are cotton, jute, wool, and silk. Fibres that are made by man from chemical substances are called synthetic fibres. Examples are nylon, rayon, polyester, and acrylic.</p></h3>
     
     <br>
     
     <h2><u>CHAPTER 4</u></h2>
     <h2> Sorting Materials Into Groups </h2>
<p><h3>There is a vast variety of objects everywhere. All objects around us are made up of one or more materials. A thing can be made of different materials. Many things can be made from the same material. Classification: The process of sorting and grouping things according to some basis is’called classification. Basis of grouping: We can group materials on the basis of the similarities and differences in their properties. Lustre: Some materials have a special shine on them which is called lustre. Material: The matter of which an object is made, is called material. For example, glass, steel, wood, etc. Metals: Materials which have certain properties like, lustre, malleability, ductility and are sonorous, good conductors of heat and electricity, are called metals. Opaque: Materials which do not allow light to pass through them are called opaque. Rough: Some materials have uneven surface and feel rough on touching. Soluble: Materials which dissolve in water are called soluble. Translucent: Materials which part ally allow light to pass through them are called translucent. Transparent: Materials which allow light to pass through them are called transparent.</p></h3>

     <br>
     
     <h2><u>CHAPTER 5</u></h2>
     <h2> Separation of Substances </h2>
<p><h3>Pure Substances: Many substances around us contain only one type of constituent particles. Elements and compounds are pure substances. Some of the pure substances are iron, copper, water, salt, etc. Impure Substances: Substances containing more than one type of constituent particles are called impure substances. Some of the impure substances are pond water, milk, etc. Impurities: These are the unwanted particles present in a substance making it impure. Mixtures: Substances which contain more than one component mixed in any ratio are called mixtures. For example, air is a mixture of many gases like nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, dust particles, etc. Homogeneous Mixtures: The mixtures in which the particles of the sub*     . Need for Separation: We carry out the separation of the components of a mixture or an impure substance with the following purposes: To remove the unuseful or harmful component. To obtain the useful component. To remove impurities for getting a pure sample.
Methods of seperation:-

• Churning.
• Condensation.
• Crystallization.
• Decantation.
• Evaporation.
• Filtration.
• Hand picking.
• Loading .
• Sedimentation.
• Thrashing.
• Winnowing.

     <h2><u>CHAPTER 6</u></h2>
     <h2> Changes Around Us </h2>

<p><h3>We can bring about a change in a substance by doing one or more of the following processes: 

Heating.
Applying force.
Mixing it with something else.
Changes caused by heating: When an object is heated, it gets affected in one or many possible ways.
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left;">Some objects get hot but do not change in any other way.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Some objects get hot and also expand in size.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Some objects get hot and begin to bum.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Some objects get hot and change their state.</li>
</ul><br>
Changes by applying pressure: When we apply force to an object, we can change its shape and size.
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left;">Air can be compressed.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Metals can be hammered into thin sheets.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Elastic can be stretched.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Cotton can be spun into thin threads.</li>
</ul><br>
Changes by mixing a substance with other: We can bring about a change in a substance by mixing it with another. For example, making solution by mixing water soluble substances in water. Metals expand on heating and contract on cooling. Chemical changes: These are the changes in which chemical properties of a substance change, and a new substance is formed. For example, cooking of food.
Physical changes: These are the changes in which only physical property of a substance changes and no new substance is formed.
<br>
Characteristics of physical changes:
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left;">No new substances are formed.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Products are identical to the reactants.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">These changes are reversible.</li>
</ul><br>
Characteristics of chemical changes:
<br>
Properties of products are different from the properties of reactants.
Most of the chemical changes are irreversible.
These changes always result in energy changes.
<u>Reversible changes:</u> These are the changes that can be reversed. For example, stretching of rubber.
<br>
<u>Irreversible changes:</u> These are the changes which cannot be brought back to its original state. For example, burning of paper.
<br>
<u>Melting point:</u> A constant temperature at which a solid starts melting. This temperature is called the melting point of that solid.
<br>
<u>Freezing:</u> A process in which liquid changes into solid form is called freezing.
<br>
<u>Force:</u> A push or a pull acting on a body which tends to change its state of rest or motion is called a force.
<br>
<u>Natural changes:</u> The changes which occur in nature on their own are called natural changes. For example, change of day and night, change of season.
<br>
<u>Slow changes:</u> The changes which take longer time to occur are called slow changes. For example, rusting of iron, tooth decay.
<br>
<u>Changes:</u> Many changes are taken place around us on their own, e.g., flowers bloom and then wither away. We can also bring a change, e.g., change in the size of a balloon by blowing air in it.
<br>
<u>Contraction:</u> A process in which an object becomes smaller or shrinks is called contraction.
<br>
<u>Evaporation:</u> A process in which liquid changes into vapour is called evaporation.
<br>
<u>Expansion:</u> A process in which an object becomes bigger in size, e.g., metals expand on heating.
<br>
<u>Melting:</u> A process in which a solid melts to become a liquid on heating is called melting.
<br>
Reversible And Irreversible Changes:-

Changes that occur around us can be broadly categorized as reversible or irreversible depending on whether or not they can be reversed.

 <br>
     <h2><u>CHAPTER 7</u></h2>
     <h2> Getting to Know Plants</h2>
<p><h3>Flowering Plants: Plants which bear flowers are called flowering plants. Their bodies are divided into roots, stem, leaves and bear flowers and fruits. Herbs, shrubs and trees: Plants are usually grouped into herbs, shrubs and trees on the basis of their heights, stem and branches:
(а) Herbs: Plants with green and tender stem are called herbs. They are usually short and sometimes do not have branches.
(b) Shrubs: Some plants have branches arising from the base of the stem. The stem is hard but not very thick. They are called shrubs.
(c) Trees: Some plants are very tall and have hard and thick stem. They have branches arising from upper part of the stem. They are called trees.

     <br> 
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left;">Roots:- a) Tap roots   b) Fibrous roots</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Parts of flower:-
Pedicel: The stalk that joins a flower to the plant is called the pedicel.
Sepals: It is the outermost whorl of the flower. Often they are small, green leaf like structures. They protect the inner parts of a flower while it is still a bud.
Petals: Inside the sepals there is the whorl of petals. Different flowers have petals of different colours. Some flowers have sweet smelling petals. With its colour and fragrance, the petals attract not only the human beings but also the insects and the birds.
Stamens: These are 4-6 in number and are male reproductive part of a flower. Each stamen is made up of two parts—filament and anther. Anther contains pollen grains.
Pistil: It is the innermost part of a flower.</li>
</ul><br>

Ovary can be divided into three parts:
<ol type="1">
<li style="text-align:left;"> Stigma</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Style</li> 
<li style="text-align:left;">Ovary</li>
</ol>
Ovary may further be divided into locules. Locules contain ovules.
</h3></p>

 <br>
     <h2><u>CHAPTER 8</u></h2>
     <h2> Body Movements </h2>

<p><h3><u>Skeletal System</u>
<br>
Bones in our body form the framework that supports the whole body. This framework is called the skeleton.
Our skeleton is made up of a number of bones and cartilages.
There are about 650 muscles attached to the various bones in our body.
The bones are hard and rigid.
Cartilages are comparatively soft and elastic.
<br>
Functions of skeleton:-
<br><ul>
<li style="text-align:left;">Skeleton system gives support to the body.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">It protects the inner organs.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Together with muscles, it gives the body its shape.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Red blood cells and some white blood cells are produced in the marrow of the bone.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Muscles: The bones are moved by the alternate contractions and relaxations of two sets of muscles.

Tendons: join muscles to the bones.

Ligament: joins two bones.

Cavity: It is the hollow space or cavity in one bone, into which the other bone fits. Such joint allows movements in all directions.

Locomotion:-

There are two kinds of movements:
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left;">The organisms move their body parts without changing their position.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Animals move from one place to another. This kind of movement is called locomotion.</li>
</ul><br>
Locomotion in some Animals
<br><ul>
<li style="text-align:left;">Bird:- 
Most of the birds have two kinds of locomotion. They walk with legs on the ground. They also fly in the air. Ducks and swans also swim in water.
Flying adaptations: Streamlined body, bones with air spaces, forelimbs modified into wings, air sacs connected to lungs and massive flight muscles are some adaptations in birds for flying.</li>

<li style="text-align:left;">Fish:-
The fish swims by forming loops alternately on the two sides of the body. The tail pushes them forward. The vertebrae and the muscles attached to them work for it.</li>

<li style="text-align:left;">Snakes:-
Similarly, the snakes crawl on the ground by alternately looping sideways. A large number of vertebrae and associated muscles push the body forward. The ventral scales also help in the process.</li>

<li style="text-align:left;">Insects:-
The body and legs of insects have hard joined coverings, forming an exoskeleton. The muscles of the breast connected with three pairs of legs and two pairs of wings help the cockroach to walk and fly.</li>
</ul></h3></p>

     <h2><u>CHAPTER 9</u></h2>
     <h2> The Living Organisms and their Surrounding </h2>

<p><h3><u>Aquatic habitat:</u>
<br>
When organisms live in water, this place of living is known as aquatic habitat.
Ponds, lakes, rivers, oceans, etc., are examples of aquatic habitat.
Water is a medium in aquatic habitat.
<br>
<u>Terrestrial habitat:</u>
<br>
When organisms live on land, this place of living is known as terrestrial habitat.
Forests, deserts, orchards, tea gardens and mountains are the examples of terrestrial habitat.
Air is the medium in terrestrial habitat.
<br>
<u>Mountain:</u>
<br>
The mountain is a special terrestrial habitat where temperature is very low and most of the areas are covered with snow.
The plants like grasses, mosses and lichens and animals like snow bear, fox, water fowl, musk deer and wolf are found commonly in this habitat.
Several kinds of plants and animals may share the same habitat.
<br><ul>
<li style="text-align:left;"><u>Adaptation:</u> The change of specific features and habits, which enables a plant or an animal to live in a particular habitat is called adaptation.</li>

<li style="text-align:left;"><u>Living things:</u> These are the objects which need water, air and nutrients for their survival.</li>

<li style="text-align:left;"><u>Non-living things:</u> These are the objects which do not need water, air and nutrients for their survival.</li>
</ul>

<br>

<u>Life:</u> It is a process seen only in living objects in the form of growth, movement, feeding or eating, sensitivity, respiration, excretion and reproduction.

Characteristics of the living things: All living things on this earth possess certain basic characteristics. These include the following:
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left;">Growth</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Movement</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Feeding</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Responsiveness</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Excretion</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Respiration</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Cellular structure</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Reproduction</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Adaptation</li>
</ul><br>

<u>Growth:</u> It is defined as the permanent irreversible increase in the size and total weight of the living object.
<br>
<u>Life Span:</u> Each animal lives for a certain period. This period is referred to as life span.
<br>
<u>Movement:</u> Change in the position from one place to other is called movement.
<br>
<u>Nutrition:</u> The process of taking food by organisms is generally referred to as nutrition or nourishment.
<br>
Food and water are essential for life:-

Food provides energy that helps in the growth of body and its repair.
<ol type="i">
<li style="text-align:left;">Autotrophs: They are the living forms which can synthesize their own food by photosynthesis, e.g., green plants.</li>

<li style="text-align:left;">Heterotrophs: They are the living organisms which cannot manufacture their own food, e.g., all animals.</li>

<li style="text-align:left;">Saprophytes: The living organisms which obtain their nutrition from the dead plants and animals are called saprophytes.</li>

<li style="text-align:left;">Parasites: The plants and animals that feed on the other living bodies are called parasites.</li>
</ol>
</h3></p>
 <br>
     <h2><u>CHAPTER 10</u></h2>
     <h2> Motion and Measurement of Distances </h2>

<p><h3>In ancient time man used to move only on foot and carry goods either on his back or on the back of some animals.

A great change in the modes of transport was made:
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left;">by the invention of wheel.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">by the invention of steam engine.</li>
</ul><br>

<u>Non-standard measures:</u> The lengths of steps, arms, hands, or fingers of different people are different, therefore the distance measured with their help is not always reliable. These methods are, therefore, called non-standard measures.
<br>
<u>Standard measures:</u> Measures that are the same all over the world are known as standard measures.
<br>
In October 1960, the 12th general conference on weight and measures adopted the International system of units. “The System International Units” is the set of units to maintain uniformity all over the world.<br>

<u>Metre:</u> It is the standard unit of length. The symbol of metre is m.

Sub-multiples of units: Units used for measuring smaller distances are the sub-multiples of SI units.
For example, milli, centi, deci.
1 m = 10 decimetre
1 m = 100 centimetre
1 m = 1000 millimetre.
<br>

<u>Least count:</u> A scale is marked in centimetres and millimetres. With the scales of this kind we can measure correctly up to one millimetre, that is one-tenth of a centimetre. This is called the least count of a (15 cm) scale.
Measuring the length of a curved line: We cannot measure the length of a curved line directly by using a metre scale. We can use a thread or divider to measure the length of a curved line.
<br>
<u>Motion:</u> It is a state of objects in which they are moving, that is, they are changing their place with the changing time.<br>

<u>Rest:</u> All the stationary objects which are not in motion, that is, do not change their place with time are said to be at rest.<br>

<u>Unit of measurements:</u>

It involves the comparison of an unknown quantity with some known quantity of the same kind.

This known fixed quantity is called unit.

The result of measurement is expressed in two parts. One part is a number; the other part is the unit of measurement.

Distance: Measurement of gap between two points in certain units is called distance.

Measurement: Measurement means the comparison of an unknown quantity with some known quantity.</h3></p>
