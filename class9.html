     <h1><u>SCIENCE</u></h1>

     <h2><u>CHAPTER 1</u></h2>
      <h2> Matter in Our Surrounding </h2>
<p><h3>Anything that has mass and takes up space is referred to as matter. hydrogen and oxygen, sugar and sand, air and water, etc. Small, minuscule particles make up matter. Due to the space between them, matter particles are attracted to one another.
<br><br><ul type="none">
<li style="text-align:left;">States of Matter:-</li></ul>
<br>
Matter can be classified as solid, liquid and gas on the basis of interparticle forces and the arrangement of particles.
These three forms of matter are interconvertible by increasing or decreasing pressure and temperature.  For example, ice can be converted from solid to a liquid by increasing the temperature.
<br><br><ul type="none">
<li style="text-align:left;">Physical Nature of Matter:-</li></ul>

<li style="text-align:left;">A physical property is that aspect of the matter that can be observed or measured without changing its nature or composition.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">It is independent of the amount of matter present.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Physical properties include appearance, colour, odour, density, texture, melting point, boiling point, solubility, etc.</li>

<br><br><ul type="none">
<li style="text-align:left;">Characteristics of Particles of Matter:-</li></ul>

<li style="text-align:left;">Everything that we can touch, see, hear, taste and also smell is matter.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">It is made up of really tiny particles which cannot be seen through the eye.</li>

<ol type="1">
<li style="text-align:left;">Particles of matter have spaces between them.
This characteristic is one of the concepts behind the solubility of a substance in other substances. For example, on dissolving sugar in water, there is no rise in water level because the particles of sugar get into the interparticle spaces between the water particles.</li>

<li style="text-align:left;">Particles of matter are always in motion.</li>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left;">Particles of the matter show continuous random movements due to the kinetic energy they possess.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">A rise in temperature increases the kinetic energy of the particles, making them move more vigorously.</li>
</ul>

<li style="text-align:left;">Particles of matter attract each other.</li>
</ol>
In every substance, there is an interparticle force of attraction acting between the particles. To break a substance we need to overcome this force. The strength of the force differs from one substance to another.

<br><br><ul type="none">
<li style="text-align:left;">Effect of change of temperature on state of matter:-</li></ul>

On increasing temperature, the kinetic energy of the particles of the matter increases and they begin to vibrate with a higher energy. Therefore, the interparticle force of attraction between the particles reduces and particles get detached from their position and begin to move freely.

<li style="text-align:left;">As a result, the state of matter begins to change.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Solids undergo a phase change to form liquids.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Similarly, liquids also undergo a phase change to form gases.</li>
<br>
<ul type="none">
<li style="text-align:left;">Melting point:-

The melting point of a solid is defined as the temperature at which solid melts to become liquid at the atmospheric pressure.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">Boiling point:-

The boiling point of a liquid is defined as the temperature at which the vapour pressure of the liquid is equal to the atmospheric pressure.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">Fusion:-

When two atoms collide to create a heavier atom, such as when two hydrogen atoms combine to create one helium atom, this process is known as fusion. This process generates enormous amounts of energy, many times more than fission, and powers the sun. Furthermore, it doesn’t generate radioactive fission products.</li></ul>

     <h2><u>CHAPTER 3</u></h2>
      <h2> Atoms and Molecules </h2>
<p><h3><ul type="none">
<li style="text-align:left;">
Law of Chemical Combination:-</li></ul>
<ul type="none">
<li style="text-align:left;">Given by Lavoisier and Joseph L. Proust as follows:</li></ul>
<ol type="1">
<li style="text-align:left;"> Law of conservation of mass: Mass can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. e.g., A + B → C + D Reactants → Products Mass of reactants = Mass of products.</li>

<li style="text-align:left;"> Law of constant proportion:

In a chemical substance the elements are always present in definite proportions by mass.
E.g., in water, the ratio of the mass of hydrogen to the mass of oxygen is always 1 : 8 respectively.
These laws lacked explanation. Hence, John Dalton gave his theory about the matter. He said that the smallest particle of matter is called ‘atom’.</li>

<li style="text-align:left;">Dalton’s Atomic Theory:

•Every matter is made up of very small or tiny particles called atoms.
•Atoms are not divisible and cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction.
•All atoms of a given element are same in size, mass and chemical properties.
•Atoms of different elements are different in size, mass and chemical properties.
•Atoms combine in the ratio of a small whole number to form compounds.</li>

<li style="text-align:left;">Atom:

Atoms are the smallest particles of an element which can take part in a chemical reaction.
Size of an atom: Atomic radius is measured in nanometres.</li>


<li style="text-align:left;">Molecule:

It is the smallest particle of an element or a compound which can exist independently.</li>


<li style="text-align:left;">Atomicity:

The number of atoms constituting a Molecule is known as its atomicity.</li>

<li style="text-align:left;">Ions:

The charged particles (atoms) are called ions, they are formed by attaining positive charge or negative charge on it.
Negatively charged ion is called anion (Cl–).
Positively charged ion is called cation (Na+).</li>

<li style="text-align:left;">Valency:

The combining capacity of an element is known as its valency.</li>


<li style="text-align:left;">Molecular Mass:

It is the sum of the atomic masses of all the atoms in a molecule of the substance. It is expressed in atomic mass unit (u).</li>

<li style="text-align:left;">Mole Concept:

Definition of mole: It is defined as one mole of any species (atoms, molecules, ions or particles) is that quantity in number having a mass equal to its atomic or molecular mass in grams.

1 mole = 6.022 x 1023 in number
Molar mass = mass of 1 mole → is always expressed in grams and is also known as gram atomic mass.</li></ol>
</h3></p>
     <h2><u>CHAPTER 4</u></h2>
      <h2> Structure of the Atom </h2>
<p><h3> The word environment finds its origin in the French word environment, which means “surrounding”. The concept of the natural environment can be classified into two significant components:-

<li style="text-align:left;">The ecological units as a whole function as a natural system and is not intervened by human civilization. It is inclusive of all the vegetation, microorganisms, rocks, soil, atmosphere, etc. which occurs within their boundaries.</li>

<li style="text-align:left;">All the available natural resources and physical phenomena that do not have a clear and limited boundary. For instance air, water, radiation, climate, etc, and everything that does not find its origin in the actions of human civilization.</li>

<br><br>
<ul type="none"><li style="text-align:left;">
Importance of Environment:-

As we all know, the environment is the key to the existence of all and any life forms on Earth. However, factors like global warming, pollution, and the increasing number of industries have brought in environmental changes. There is a need to conserve the environment but for doing it first we need to understand why it is important.

Water- Which covers the largest portions of the Earth, is the essential medium for all the reactions and physiological processes of the body. If water gets contaminated with waste and toxins or microorganisms which cause diseases, then it will be a great risk drinking the same.

Soil- Another important component is soil which supports the growth of all the vegetation. It is also considered a vital source for metals, several chemicals, etc. Thus, it becomes important to conserve the soil for better living.

Plants- Plants and trees providers of oxygen without which neither animals nor humans can survive. They are the ones that can help in reducing the global warming component, CO2, from the environment and provide a clean environment. With the destruction of the environment around us, the plants are being destroyed too and immediate steps are necessary for their conservation.

Food, Shelter, and Clothing-  The daily needs of food and shelter, which are very basic for all animals and humans, are derived from the environment around us. With the destruction of the environment, we are also destroying the source of all our basic needs.
</li></ul>
<br><br>
<ul type="none"><li style="text-align:left;">
Ecosystem:-

The ecosystem is the term used for a natural unit that includes all the plants, animals, and microorganisms in a particular area.

There are mainly two types of ecosystems – natural ecosystems and artificial ecosystems.
<br>
The natural ecosystem can be segregated into “biomes”. The three major types are discussed below:</li></ul>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">Aquatic Biomes</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Terrestrial Biomes</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Lentic Biomes</li>
<br>
<ul type="none"><li style="text-align:left;">
Artificial Ecosystem- It is the artificial environment that has been created and maintained by man such as gardens, aquariums etc. 

There are two components of the ecosystem – biotic and abiotic.</li></ul>

<ol type="i">
<li style="text-align:left;">Abiotic Component- The abiotic component encompasses the inorganic elements and compounds like air, water, calcium carbonates etc. which are the – products of organic activities.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">Biotic Component- The biotic components take into consideration all the living organisms present in an ecosystem.</li></ol>
</h3></p>
     <h2><u>CHAPTER 5</u></h2>
      <h2> The Fundamental Unit of Life </h2>
<p><h3><ul type="none"><li style="text-align:left;">The smallest functional unit of life is a cell, discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665. A cell can independently perform all necessary activities to sustain life. Hence cell is the basic unit of life.
There are two types of cells plant cell and animal cell. The different cell organelles and their functions are as follows:</li></ul>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">Plasma/Cell membrane</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Cell wall</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Nucleus</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Cytoplasm</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Cell organelles</li>
<ol type="i">
<li style="text-align:left;">Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) (Channels, Network for transport):

The ER is a large network of membrane-bound tubes and sheets. It looks like long tubules or round or oblong bags.
There are two types of ER-Rough endoplasmic reticulum [RER] and smooth endoplasmic reticulum [SER]. The ribosomes Endoplasmic Reticulum are the sites of protein manufacture.

The SER helps in the manufacture of fat molecules, or lipids, important for cell function.</li>


<li style="text-align:left;">Golgi Apparatus (Packaging):

It’s function include the storage, modification and packages of products in vesicles. In some cases complex sugar may be made from simple sugar in the Golgi apparatus.</li>

<li style="text-align:left;">Lysosomes [Suichge bags] (Cleanliness of cell):

 Lysosomes are a kind of waste dispatch and disposal system of the cell. Lysosome help to keep the cell clean by digesting any foreign material as well as worn-out cell organelles.</li>


<li style="text-align:left;">Mitochondria (Powerhouse, Energy provider):

 Mitochondria are known as powerhouses of the cell. The energy required for various chemical activities needed for life is released by mitochondria in the form of ATP [Adenosine Triphosphate] molecules.</li>

<li style="text-align:left;">Plastids: 

Plastids are present only in plant cells. There are two types of plastids chromoplasts and leucoplasts.

Plastids containing the pigment chlorophyll are known as chloroplasts. They are important for photosynthesis in plants.  


Leucoplasts are found primarily in organelles in which materials such as starch, oils and protein granules are stored.</li>

<li style="text-align:left;">Vacuoles (Storage): 

Vacuoles are storage sacs for solid or liquid contents. Vacuoles are small-sized in animal cells while plant cells have very large vacuoles [50% to 90% cell volume].</li>
</h3></p>
     <h2><u>CHAPTER 6</u></h2>
      <h2> Tissues </h2>
<p><h3><ul type="none"><li style="text-align:left;">Tissues:-

Group of cells having a common origin and similar function are termed as tissues.</li></ul>
<ol type="A"><li style="text-align:left;">
A. Plant tissues: On the basis of the dividing capacity, plant tissues are of two types:
<ol type="1"><li style="text-align:left;">
Meristematic tissues:</li>
Consist of actively-dividing cells. Meristematic tissues are of three types:
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left;">Apical meristem</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Intercalary meristem</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Lateral meristem</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Permanent tissues: Formed from meristematic tissues, the cells in the tissue loose the ability to divider Permanent tissues are divided into two categories:

Simple permanent tissue: Consist of only one type of cells.
Types of simple permanent tissues:

•Parenchyma
•Collenchyma
•Sclerenchyma

Complex permanent tissue: Made up of more than one type of cells (Conducting tissues.)
Types of complex permanent tissues:

•Xylem
•Phloem


B. Animal tissues: Animal tissues are classified into four types based on the functions they perform:

1.Epithelial
2.Connective
3.Muscular
4.Nervous

1. Epithelial tissues: Form the covering of the external surfaces, internal cavities and organs of the animal body. Various types of epithelial tissues are:

•Simple squamous epithelium
•Cuboidal epithelium
•Columnar epithelium
21. Connective tissues: Specialised to connect various body organs. Various types of connective tissues:, are:

•Areolar tissue
•Adipose tissue
•Dense regular connective tissue
•Skeletal tissue
•Fluid tissue


3. Muscular tissues: Main function of muscular tissues is to provide movement to the body. Muscular tissues are of three types:

•Striated muscles or skeletal muscles or voluntary muscles
•Smooth muscle or involuntary muscle
•Cardiac muscle or involuntary muscle

4. Nervous tissues: Present in the brain, spinal cord and nerves.

Neuron: Cells of the nervous tissue.

A neuron: consists of a cell body, an axon and a dendrite.

     <h2><u>CHAPTER 7</u></h2>
      <h2> Diversity in Living Organism </h2>
<p><h3><ul type="none"><li style="text-align:left;">
Diversity: This earth is full of organisms of various shapes and sizes. The largest Phylum of animal kingdom alone contains over a million species. There are varieties of plants, right from small grasses to tall Eucalyptus trees. This variety in living beings is called diversity.</li>
<br><li style="text-align:left;">
Biodiversity: The variety of animals and plants living in a given geographical area is called biodiversity of that geographical area.</li>
Need for a System of Classification: Because of the huge diversity in living beings it becomes very difficult task to study each of them one by one. To make their study easier animals and plants were categorized in groups and sub¬groups. Thus the system of classification started.
<br><li style="text-align:left;">
Basis of Classification :-</li></ul>
<ol type="a"><li style="text-align:left;">
Presence or Absence of Nucleus in Cells.
<ul type="none">
<li style="text-align:left;">Prokaryotes: Those organisms which have cells without well defined nucleus are called prokaryotes.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Eukaryotes: Those organisms which have cells with well defined nucleus are Called eukaryotes. Presence of nucleus and membrane-bound organelles gives better efficiency to cells.</li></ul>
</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">Number of Cells in an Organism.
<ul type="none">
<li style="text-align:left;">Unicellular: Those organisms having single cell are termed as unicellular organisms. In them the single cell is responsible for carrying out all necessary functions to maintain life.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Multicellular: Those organisms having more than one cell are called multicellular organisms. Because of more number of cells there can be some division of labour to gain more efficiency.</li></ul>
</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">Mode of Nutrition.
<ul type="none">
<li style="text-align:left;">Autotrophs: Organisms producing their own food are called autotrophs. All green plants are autotrophs. They have a pigment (chlorophyll) in green parts which facilitates photosynthesis.</li>

<li style="text-align:left;">Heterotrophs: Organisms dependent on either plants or animals are called heterotrophs.They don’t have chlorophylls. All animals, fungi and certain bacteria and protozoa belong to this group.</li></ul>
</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">Level of Organisation in Body.
<ul type="none">
<li style="text-align:left;">In multicellular organisms which are small, like hydra particular group of cells are assigned a particular function. But in larger organisms, tissues group to form an organ, which in turn make organ system. </li></ul>
</li></ol>

The Hierarchy of Classification—Groups:-

Biologists, such as Ernst Haeckel (1894), Robert Whittaker (1959) and Carl Woese (1977) have tried to classify all living organisms into broad categories, called kingdoms.
<ul type="none"><li style="text-align:left;">
Whittaker’s Five Kingdom Classification:</li></ul>

<li style="text-align:left;">Phylum (for animals)/Division (for plants)</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Class</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Order</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Family</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Genus</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Species</li>
<br>
Thus, by separating organisms on the basis of a hierarchy of characteristics into smaller and smaller groups, we arrive at the basic unit of classification, which is a ‘species’. Broadly, a species includes all organisms that are similar enough to breed and perpetuate.

<li style="text-align:left;">Monera</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Protista</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Fungi</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Lichens</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Plantae</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Animalia</li>
<br>
<ul type="none">
<li style="text-align:left;">Conventions for writing the scientific names:</li></ul>
<li style="text-align:left;">The name of the genus begins with a capital letter.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">The name of the species begins with a small letter.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">When printed, the scientific name is given in italics.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">When written by hand, the genus name and the species name have to be underlined separately.</li>
</h3></p>
     <h2><u>CHAPTER 8</u></h2>
      <h2> Motion </h2>
<p><h3>An object is said to be in motion when its position changes with time. The shortest path/distance measured from the initial to the final position of an object is known as the displacement.
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left;">
Uniform motion: When an object covers equal distances in equal intervals of time, it is said to be in uniform motion.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">
Non-uniform motion: Motions where objects cover unequal distances in equal intervals of time.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">
Speed: The distance travelled by an object in unit time is referred to as speed. Its unit is m/s.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">
Average speed: For non-uniform motion, the average speed of an object is obtained by dividing the total distance travelled by an object by the total time taken.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">
Velocity: Velocity is the speed of an object moving indefinite direction. S.I. unit is m/s.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">
Acceleration: Change in the velocity of an object per unit time.</li>
</ul><br>
<ul type="none"><li style="text-align:left;">
Graphical representation of motions:-</li></ul>

<ol type="i">
<li style="text-align:left;">Distance-time graph</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Velocity-time graph</li>
</ol>

<ul type="none"><li style="text-align:left;">
Equation of motion by graphical methods:-</li></ul>

<ol type="i">
<li style="text-align:left;">Velocity-time relation</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">The equation for position-time relation</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Equation for position-velocity relation</li>
</ol>

<ul type="none"><li style="text-align:left;">
Uniform circular motion: When a body moves in a circular path with uniform speed, its motion is called uniform circular motion.</li></ul>
</h3></p>
     <h2><u>CHAPTER 9</u></h2>
      <h2> Force and Law of Motion </h2>
<p><h3>Force: It is a push or pulls on an object that produces an acceleration in the body on which it acts. S.I. unit of force is Newton.

A force can do three things on a body.

<li style="text-align:left;">It can change the speed of the body.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">It can change the direction of motion of a body.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">It can change the shape of a body.</li>
<br><ul type="none"><li style="text-align:left;">
Balanced forces: Forces are said to be balanced forces if they nullify one another and their resultant force is zero.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;"><br>
Frictional force: The force that always opposes the motion of objects is called a force of friction.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;"><br>
The second law of motion: The rate of change of momentum of an object is proportional to the applied unbalanced force in the direction of the force.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;"><br>
Momentum: The momentum of an object is the product of its mass and velocity and has the same direction as that of the velocity. Its S.I. unit is kg m/s.

                              (p=mv)                                                                                 </li></ul><br>


1 Newton: A force of one Newton produces an acceleration of 1 m/s2 on an object of mass 1 kg.
1 N = 1 kg m/s2 (F = ma)
<br><br><ul type="none"><li style="text-align:left;">
Third law of motion: To every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction and they act on two different bodies.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">Conservation of momentum: If the external force on a system is zero, the momentum of the system remains constant i.e., in an isolated system, the total momentum remains conserved.

Suppose A and B are two balls, they have mass mA and and initial velocities uA and uB as shown in above figure before collision. The two bodies collide and force is exerted by each body. There is change in their velocities due to collision.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">Unbalanced forces: When two opposite forces acting on a body, move a body in the direction of the greater force or forces which brings motion in a body are called as unbalanced forces.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">First law of motion: An object remains in a state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external unbalanced force.</li>
<br>
<li style="text-align:left;">Inertia: The natural tendency of an object to resist a change in their state of rest or of uniform motion is called inertia.
The mass of an object is a measure of its inertia.
Its S.I. unit is kg.</li></ul>
</h3></p>
     <h2><u>CHAPTER 10</u></h2>
      <h2> Gravitation </h2>
<p><h3><ul type="none"><li style="text-align:left;">The universal law of gravitation: Every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force which is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.</li></ul><br>
<ul type="none"><li style="text-align:left;">
Let two objects A and B of masses M and m lie at a distance of d from each other as shown in the figure.
Let F be the force of attraction between the law of gravitation
G is called a universal constant because its value does not depend on the nature of intervening medium or temperature or any other physical variable.
S.I. unit of G = Nm^2/kg^2
Value of G = 6.673 x 10-11 Nm^2/kg^2</li></ul><br>

<ul type="none"><li style="text-align:left;">
Importance of universal law of gravitation:-

Universal law of gravitation successfully explained several phenomena like:</li></ul>

<li style="text-align:left;">the force that binds us to the earth.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">the motion of moon around the earth.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">the motion of planets around the sun.</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">the tides due to the moon and the sun.</li>
<br><ul type="none"><li style="text-align:left;">
Freefall:-
When an object falls down towards the earth under the gravitational force alone, we say the object is in free fall.
The velocity of a freely falling body changes and is said to be accelerated.
This acceleration is called acceleration due to gravity, denoted by ’g’. Unit is m/s2.</li></ul>
<br>
<ul type="none"><li style="text-align:left;">
Mass: Mass of an object is the measure of its inertia. It is the matter present in it. It remains the same everywhere in the universe.</li></ul>
<br>
<ul  type="none"><li style="text-align:left;">
Weight: The force of attraction of the earth on the object is known as the weight of the object. It’s S.I. unit is Newton.
W = m x g.</li></ul>
